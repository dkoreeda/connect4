# project-01: Connect4

a. 2 players have different colored discs: red or yellow

b. Blue board: 6x5 discs (width x height)

c. The game board has gaps at the top where a player drops a disc and it falls straight down as far as it can go, occupying the next available space within that column

d. The player has to use his/her own pieces to block his/her opponent

Goal: Be the first to connect 4 pieces in a row, column or diagonally


### Foreseen challenges or obstacles:
1. Create array (row x column) that will save the position of pieces
2. Apply CSS style and Javascript to slide down pieces inside the board - from the top of it to an available spot in a particular column in the array
3. Write the winner logic with all possibilities regarding vertical, horizontal and diagonal combinations
4. Media query for tablets, cellphones and laptops/desktops

###Technology:
1. HTML and CSS to build content and style my landing (index.html) and game (game-page.html) pages
2. The structure of the board game will be created by using DOM Manipulation with JQ and CSS flexbox
3. Also jQuery will be used for for animation (slide discs down) and toggle classes to visually change players
